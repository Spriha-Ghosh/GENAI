text translation, voice recognition, text summarization, and chatbots. You may have used some of these applications yourself, such as voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text software, and customer service bots
1. Text Processing and Preprocessing In NLP
Tokenization: Dividing text into smaller units, such as words or sentences.
Stemming and Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root forms.
Stopword Removal: Removing common words (like “and”, “the”, “is”) that may not carry significant meaning.
Text Normalization: Standardizing text, including case normalization, removing punctuation, and correcting spelling errors.
2. Syntax and Parsing In NLP
Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Assigning parts of speech to each word in a sentence (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).
Dependency Parsing: Analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence to identify relationships between words.
Constituency Parsing: Breaking down a sentence into its constituent parts or phrases (e.g., noun phrases, verb phrases).
3. Semantic Analysis
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying entities in text, such as names of people, organizations, locations, dates, etc.
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD): Determining which meaning of a word is used in a given context.
Coreference Resolution: Identifying when different words refer to the same entity in a text (e.g., “he” refers to “John”).
4. Information Extraction
Entity Extraction: Identifying specific entities and their relationships within the text.
Relation Extraction: Identifying and categorizing the relationships between entities in a text.
5. Text Classification in NLP
Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a text (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
Topic Modeling: Identifying topics or themes within a large collection of documents.
Spam Detection: Classifying text as spam or not spam.
6. Language Generation
Machine Translation: Translating text from one language to another.
Text Summarization: Producing a concise summary of a larger text.
Text Generation: Automatically generating coherent and contextually relevant text.
7. Speech Processing
Speech Recognition: Converting spoken language into text.
Text-to-Speech (TTS) Synthesis: Converting written text into spoken language.
8. Question Answering
Retrieval-Based QA: Finding and returning the most relevant text passage in response to a query.
Generative QA: Generating an answer based on the information available in a text corpus.
9. Dialogue Systems
Chatbots and Virtual Assistants: Enabling systems to engage in conversations with users, providing responses and performing tasks based on user input.
10. Sentiment and Emotion Analysis in NLP
Emotion Detection: Identifying and categorizing emotions expressed in text.
Opinion Mining: Analyzing opinions or reviews to understand public sentiment toward products, services, or topics.
